## Mobius Strip Generator using Python

This program generates a Mobius Strip, a non-orientable surface with only one side and one boundary. The implementation is done in Python.

## Overview

The Mobius Strip generator creates a visual representation of a Mobius Strip, a surface with unique topological properties. The program displays a 3D rendering of the Mobius Strip in a graphical window.

## Prerequisites

To run this program, you'll need:
- Python (3.x recommended)
- Pygame library

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saolghra/mobius-strip.git
